Description: # The-GeoLiberator-Python-Module
        The module takes in a address as an argument and outputs a standardized version.
        Otherwise, 'OTHER' will be the output.
        It is alike a liberal because it takes in any variant addresses indiscriminately.
        And it is a liberator because it liberates the addresses from their inconsistencies.
        (Note: This module does not do address validation but it will parse any address you throw at it to the best of its ability)
        
        To start:
        from GeoLiberator import geoliberator
        
        geoliberator.geoLiberate("123 Example St", 2) # '2' to parse a full address
