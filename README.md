# The-GeoLiberator-Python-Module
The module takes in a address as an argument and outputs a standardized version.
Otherwise, 'OTHER' will be the output.
It is alike a liberal because it takes in any variant addresses indiscriminately.
And it is a liberator because it liberates the addresses from their inconsistincy.
(Note: This module does not do address validation but it will parse any address you throw at it to the best of its ability)
